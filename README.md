# CUNY MarketPlace

CUNY Marketplace is a student-driven platform where CUNY students across all campuses can buy, sell, trade, or give away items. Whether it's textbooks, dorm essentials, or everyday goods, students can easily connect with each other to exchange items they no longer need. Inspired by Facebook Marketplace, this secure, campus-exclusive space helps students save money, reduce waste, and support one another through peer-to-peer exchange.
